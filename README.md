### 💡 What I Do
In my current role, I focus on building **secure medical devices** and ensuring **regulatory compliance** for products in complex healthcare environments. My core activities include:

- **Leading Security Architecture Initiatives**: Directing threat modeling, security reviews, and risk management to establish secure infrastructures that protect patient data integrity.
- **Zero Trust Implementation**: Spearheading **Zero Trust Architecture** across product lines, mitigating unauthorized access risks, and setting benchmarks in cybersecurity compliance.
- **Collaboration for Compliance**: Working alongside regulatory and development teams to align product security with **HIPAA**, **FDA**, **GDPR**, **MDR**, and **ISO 27001** standards.
- **Incident Response & Forensics**: Developing incident response strategies and conducting digital forensics to ensure rapid recovery and minimal impact during security events.

I'm always looking for opportunities to blend security with innovation in healthcare, helping organizations navigate security complexities while delivering impactful healthcare solutions.
