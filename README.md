![About Me Banner](https://i.ibb.co/Wng50Np/Designer-9.jpg)  

### üöÄ About Me  

I'm a Principal Product Security Engineer with expertise in designing and securing cutting-edge products for various industries. From healthcare to IoT and software applications, my passion lies in safeguarding innovation through advanced security frameworks and compliance. I believe in embedding security at every stage of the product lifecycle, ensuring resilience and trust in every solution.

Here‚Äôs what I specialize in:
- **Product Security & Compliance**: Mastering complex regulatory environments (e.g., **HIPAA**, **GDPR**, **ISO 27001**) and aligning product development with security best practices.
- **Threat Modeling & Secure Architecture**: Building systems that not only withstand modern threats but also remain agile in meeting evolving user and business needs.
- **Secure Product Development**: Driving innovation without compromising security, using frameworks like **Zero Trust** and **Privacy by Design**.

### üí° What I Do  

I lead cross-functional teams in embedding security into the DNA of products across sectors. Here's what I bring to the table:  

- **Product Security Strategy**: Establishing secure development lifecycles (SDLCs), integrating threat modeling, and championing secure-by-design principles.  
- **Cross-Industry Compliance**: Navigating regulations like **HIPAA**, **GDPR**, **CMMC**, and **ISO 27001** to deliver compliant and secure solutions.  
- **Emerging Tech Expertise**: Exploring the intersection of security and innovation, whether it's in medical devices, IoT ecosystems, or cloud applications.  
- **Incident Response & Forensics**: Crafting tailored incident response plans and conducting digital forensics to mitigate risks and ensure business continuity.
